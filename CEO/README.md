### The difficulty level for a CEO to obtain this information regularly can vary depending on several factors:

1. **Data Availability:** If the necessary data for these metrics is readily available and well-organized within the company's systems, obtaining the information can be relatively straightforward. However, if data is scattered across different departments or stored in disparate systems, it may require more effort to consolidate and analyze.

2. **Reporting Tools and Processes:** The availability of efficient reporting tools and processes can significantly impact the ease of accessing this information. If the company has robust reporting mechanisms in place, such as automated dashboards or regular performance reports, the CEO can easily access the metrics they need. Conversely, if reporting processes are manual or outdated, it may require more time and resources to gather and analyze the data.

3. **Data Accuracy and Reliability:** Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the data is essential for informed decision-making. If the data is incomplete, outdated, or inaccurate, it can hinder the CEO's ability to trust the information and make strategic decisions based on it. Therefore, maintaining data integrity is crucial for effectively monitoring these metrics.

4. **Resource Allocation:** Depending on the size and resources of the organization, the CEO may have dedicated teams or departments responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting on these metrics. In such cases, the CEO's role may primarily involve reviewing the reports provided by these teams. However, in smaller organizations with limited resources, the CEO may need to be more hands-on in collecting and analyzing the data themselves.
